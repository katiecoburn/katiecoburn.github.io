I am originally from San Jose, California. I obtained my B.S. in psychology from [San Jose State University](http://www.sjsu.edu/) in 2011 and my Ph. D. in quantitative psychology from the [University of California, Merced](https://www.ucmerced.edu/) in 2018, working with my advisor, Dr. [Jack L. Vevea](http://faculty.ucmerced.edu/jvevea/).

In July 2019, I was hired as a postdoctoral fellow working with the [STEPP (Statistics for Evidence-Based Policy and Practice) Center](https://stepp.center/) at [Northwestern University](https://www.northwestern.edu/). I work with Drs. [Beth Tipton](https://twitter.com/stats_tipton) and [Larry Hedges](https://www.statistics.northwestern.edu/people/faculty/larry-hedges.html). My office is in Room 201, 617 Library Place, Evanston, IL, 60208. 

My primary research interests include reproducibility and related issues, such as publication bias. My dissertation proposed a weight-function model for moderators of publication bias (factors other than statistical significance that impact studies' chance of publication). I also have considerable experience with R and have published an R package on CRAN to implement these weight-function models; see [weightr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/weightr/index.html) (Coburn & Vevea, 2015).
