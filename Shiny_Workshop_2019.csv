Agree,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,I personally enjoyed learning more about R through the interactive workshop. I really liked the style of it and the breaks helped with pacing. ,The only element I was lost about was the amount of R I should've learned beforehand but otherwise I enjoyed it personally!,"I learned how to make a basic app from around a total of 6 lost and confused hours of trying to get the basics of R. Katie Coburn, Sonja Winter, and Kyle Hamilton were all very helpful in teaching Shiny and helping with basic R things.",Somewhat likely

Strongly agree,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,"I enjoyed the coding demo(s) where we could follow along, but also had time to play with our own code without missing instruction.",I think it was great!,Instructors were able to help me troubleshoot my code multiple times! ,Extremely likely
Strongly agree,Agree,Agree,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,Covered a lot of material and provided detailed code for more advanced applications.,"Perhaps try to survey the attendees beforehand to try and determine which examples are most applicable (e.g., word clouds, statistics, plots, etc.)","Very enthusiastic even when errors are present. Therefore, I didn't feel bad about my errors.",Extremely likely
Strongly agree,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,This workshop was very well put together and very useful.,"More defined schedule of breaks (?) Really, everything was great.",The pace felt very natural and explanations were thorough and digestible. This is definitely one of the better workshops I have attended on campus.,Extremely likely
Somewhat agree,Agree,Agree,Agree,Agree,Agree,Agree,The workshop set up was clear and easy to follow and provide good material at the OSF,Probably could provide some problems to let students work on. Only by looking at the examples without practices would not help a lot.,,Somewhat likely
Agree,Somewhat agree,Agree,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,Agree,I appreciated how interactive and informal the session was. It was also helpful that the instructors ran into some errors during their presentation so that I could see how they were troubleshooting the problems.,More organized. ,I felt comfortable asking questions and interacting during the presentation. I feel comfortable contacting them in the future with questions. ,Extremely likely
Strongly agree,Somewhat agree,Agree,Agree,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,Agree,"I really like that we walk out with a fun a fully functional app in shiny that then we can modify for our own purposes. 
It was very accessible for everyone, which is something not very common in coding workshops. The instructors were very helpful and willing to work out issues. ",Devote more time to part 2. It has all the cool stuff that could be fun to apply. I know is a trade-off between making it accessible for all levels of coders and getting into more complicated/cool stuff. But I think devoting more time to the more advanced parts would be ideal to get experience with them.,,Somewhat likely
